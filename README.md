# BMI Health Tracker

BMI Health Tracker is a Flutter-based application designed to help users determine their Body Mass Index (BMI) and assess their health status. With a simple and user-friendly interface, the app allows users to enter their height and weight, and it instantly calculates their BMI. Additionally, the app dynamically changes the background color to visually represent their health status.

## Features

1. **BMI Calculation**: The main feature of the app is the BMI calculation functionality. Users can enter their height and weight, and the app will calculate their BMI using the standard formula (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters).

2. **Health Status**: Based on the calculated BMI, the app dynamically changes the background color to reflect the user's health status. Different colors represent different health categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese. This visual representation helps users quickly understand their health status at a glance.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**: The app provides a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to enter their details and view the calculated BMI. The clear and concise design ensures a seamless user experience.

4. **Feedback and Recommendations**: In addition to providing the calculated BMI and health status, the app can display feedback and recommendations based on the user's BMI category. This feature offers personalized guidance and suggestions to help users maintain or improve their health.

5. **About Page**: The about page provides information about the BMI Health Tracker app, its purpose, and the development team behind it.
